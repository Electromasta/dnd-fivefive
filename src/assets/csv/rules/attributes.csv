.,"Each creature has six ability scores that measure their physical and mental characteristics.  When making a check, attacking, defending, or saving, they test the ability score that most closely matches the task at hand.  The normal human average for a score is 10, although individuals vary wildly.  Some game mechanics require an Ability Bonus instead of score.  To determine this, subtract 10 from the score and divide the resulting number by 2, rounded down.","#scores"
