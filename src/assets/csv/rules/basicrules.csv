Dice Notation,"Uses polyhedral dice to approximate chance, signified with Dice Notation.  The most common board game dice would be referred to as 1d6, or one roll of a six sided die.  Most rolls in the game are made with a d20, or a twenty sided die.  Other dice can be used, common in many role playing games; the d12, d10, d8, d6, and d4.  ",
Roll Between System,"To see if a character succeeds at a roll, they try to roll under or equal to their character's ability score, but over the difficulty value.  For example, If a character has 15 in an ability score and a task has a Difficulty Class of 3, then they must roll a d20 and match a 3 a 15, or any number in between.  For outcomes with possible degrees of success, higher rolls (but under) is better. For tasks that are trivial or impossible, there is no need to make a check, the Game Master should rule in the obvious outcome.","#difficulty"
Advantage and Disadvantage,"Circumstantial influence like the weather, a clever tactic, surprise or item usage, or help from a friend could give advantage or disadvantage.  When that happens, you roll 2d20 when making the roll.  If a player has advantage, they pick the roll, if a player has disadvantage, the monster picks the roll that helps them the most. These should rarely be given from class features, they should be a result of unexpected, out of the box boons or banes.   Having advantage and disadvantage at the same time results in being considered to have neither of them, and multiple advantages or disadvantages do not stack for more rolls.",
Helping,"A character can provide aid to another.  When working together, one character rolls with advantage and the other forgoes their roll.  A character can only provide help if the task is one that they are able to do themselves, (for example, has Proficiency) and only when two individuals working together would actually be productive.  Two people picking a lock is harder, not easier, with help.",
Group Checks,"If the party is making a group effort, like during a negotiation or being sneaky, the GM might ask for a group ability check.  In such a citation, the characters who are skilled at a particular task help those who aren’t.  Everyone makes an ability score check, and if at least half the group succeeds, they all succeed.",
Hit Points,"A resource used to track a character’s life.  Not merely an indication of physical wounds, Hit Points represent wounds, stamina, and will to keep on going.",
Hit Dice Pool,"A resource used to restore hit points, granted by the characters class (size) and level (amount).",
Pushing,"If a character fails a check, they can choose push beyond their limits to succeed at a cost.  The standard cost for this push is spending hit points based on difficulty class.  The Game Master or Player may also create or suggest different costs, depending on the circumstances.  Pushing can’t be done when making a saving throw or defense roll.","#pushing"
"Time, Rounds, and Turns","Each Character can act and move on their turn every round. The scope of what can be done with an action increases or decreases based on the timescale.  For Overland Travel, a round is a day, for Dungeons, a round is 10 minutes, and for combat, a round is 6 seconds.  Characters can move 24 miles in a day, one room in a dungeon turn, and their movement in a combat round.  This movement assumes the character is not moving at full speed, but performing an action or actions during the round.","#time"
Initiative,"When determining turn order in combat, all characters involved declare their actions, then roll dice.  The characters with the highest d20 roll go first.  If there is a tie, the character with the longer reach or faster weapon goes first.","#initiativetie"
Usage Die,"When an item described has Ud and then a number after its name, it is a consumable or limited item.  The ‘Ud’ stands for Usage Die, the number indicating what size die it is.  An item with Ud6 would have a dice of d6.  When that item is used, its Usage Die should be rolled.  If the result is 1-2 then the Usage die is downgraded to the next smallest in the chain.  When rolling a 1-2 on a d4, the item has 1 more use left before becoming expended.   For ammunition such as arrows or bolts, roll the Ud at the end of combat, not for each usage.  The downgrading chain table is as follows.","#usagedice"
Inventory Bulk,"Characters can carry a number of items equal to 5 + their total strength.  Typically, inventory bulk should only be calculated during provisioning or returning from a dungeon.",
Long Rest,"Whenever characters take extended downtime, at least 24 hours sleeping and resting in a safe place like a town, city or sanctuary, they regain all their class features and recover all their hit points and hit dice.",
Short Rest,"Taking a short breather, characters can recover some class features and spend hit dice from their hit dice pool to recover hit points.  For each hit dice spent, they roll the die.  (Minimum constitution bonus) The character regains hit points equal to the total.",
Armor,"Armor a character wears gives the character Armor Dice, which are D6.  If a character would take hit point damage, they can Use one Armor Dice, and negate all damage from the attack.  During a short rest, characters can perform makeshift repairs by rolling their used armor dice, on a 2 or lower, that dice is broken until repaired at a smithy.",
Casting Spells,"A character with a spellcasting feature can use their action to cast a spell, using a limited resource called a spell slot.  When casting a spell, the spell caster makes an ability score check, rolling under their casting ability score.  If they succeed, they keep their spell slot, if they fail, they need to take a long rest to recover it.  The DC for the spell is equal to double its level.  If the caster has already cast the spell since their last long rest, this check is made with disadvantage.  You cannot push a casting check.",
